A pico powered, one color LED strip controller

I have a string of Fairy Lights around the permieter of my bedroom and the control unit for it keeps dying. The controller won't work right, dimming stops working... I typically resort to manually plugging and unplugging them but the brightness varies based on random factors and it's just not convenient.

So I built my own controller! PCBs are on order from PCBWay but the prototype using a relay and a voltage regulator to step down the 15v to 5v for the pico is working but the voltage regulator gets so hot that I designed a new pcb.

## Build Instructions
Coming soon... PCBs aren't ordered yet :p
